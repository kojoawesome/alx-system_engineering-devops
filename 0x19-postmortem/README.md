Issue Summary:

On May 15, 2023, starting at 3:00 PM (UTC), a web application outage occurred and lasted for two hours, impacting 75% of the users of the application. Users experienced slow or no response when attempting to access the application. The root cause was due to a database connectivity issue.

Timeline:

- 3:00 PM: Monitoring alerts indicated an increase in error rates for the web application.
- 3:05 PM: The engineering team was notified of the issue.
- 3:10 PM: Initial investigation focused on the web server logs, assuming the issue was with the web server.
- 3:20 PM: Debugging of the web server logs did not identify any issues with the server.
- 3:25 PM: Further investigation focused on the database server, as a potential source of the issue.
- 3:35 PM: The database connectivity issue was identified as the root cause of the outage.
- 3:40 PM: The incident was escalated to the database team.
- 4:00 PM: The database team determined that the issue was due to a network configuration problem and implemented a fix.
- 5:00 PM: The web application was fully restored and tested.

Root cause and resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a network configuration problem that prevented the web server from connecting to the database server. The database team identified the issue and implemented a fix that involved updating the network configuration settings. Once the settings were updated, the web application was able to connect to the database and respond to user requests.

Corrective and preventative measures:

To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following measures will be taken:

- Improve monitoring of network connectivity between the web and database servers.
- Establish a more robust disaster recovery plan to enable faster recovery times.
- Increase the frequency of database server backups to mitigate data loss in the event of an outage.




To address the immediate issue, the following tasks will be completed:

- Perform a comprehensive review of network configuration settings to ensure they are properly configured.
- Update monitoring tools to provide more detailed network connectivity metrics.
- Perform load testing of the web application to identify potential performance bottlenecks.

In conclusion, the web application outage on May 15, 2023, was caused by a network configuration problem that prevented the web server from connecting to the database server. The issue was resolved by the database team, and measures have been put in place to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
